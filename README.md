## Part 3: Website Description
The purpose of my responsive site is to serve as a personal portfolio highlighting my UI/UX and journalism projects. In my website, I included information about three HCI projects and four writing samples, including project overviews, my roles, the process, and key findings. I made the site interesting by adding interactivity using jQuery, CSS animation, and Javascript. I also made the site responsive using Bootstrap. The target audience are recruiters, peers, and people who may want to view my personal projects in HCI and journalism.

## Part 4: Interactivity
* The user enters the site and arrives at the homepage.
* The user clicks on the colored, bold text ('strategy consulting,'' 'human-centered design,' & 'telling stories about people') to see the logo replaced by various hand-drawn graphics. This was implemented using Javascript.
* The user clicks on the hand-drawn graphic to return to the initial site logo.
* The user sees the animated down arrow to signify them to scroll down. This was implemented using animation in CSS.
* The user explores the four various projects (MedFill, DCP Connect, HealthConnect, and Writing Samples) and returns back to the homepage.
* The user scrolls up to the top of the page.
* The user clicks on the 'more about me' link.
* The user clicks on my email to get a pop-up, pre-addressed email. This was implemented using Javascript.
* The user clicks on the button 'i contacted you! what's next?' and sees a pop-up graphic. The graphic is used as feedback and was implemented using the jQuery Javascript library.
* The user clicks on the logo at the top of the About page to return back to the homepage.
* The user clicks on 'i'm feeling lucky! choose a project for me' to receive a randomly-generated project. This was used to add interest to the site and was implemented using Javascript.


## Part 5: External Tools
Tool 1:
* Name of tool: jQuery Javascript Library
* Why I chose to use it: I used jQuery in my website to add interactivity and make the website more interesting for the user.
* How I used it: I used jQuery in the About page. When the user clicks on the "i contacted you! what's next?" button, a hidden hand-drawn graphic is then displayed on the About page. This was implemented using fadeIn in jQuery.
* What it adds to my website: Similarly to the homepage, I wanted to add some interactivity on the About page to make the user experience more engaging and interesting. I also wanted to implement user feedback to provide additional information. Lastly, I wanted to include hand-drawn, interactive graphics to make the experience more surprising and creative.

Tool 2:
* Name of tool: Animation
* Why I chose to use it: I used CSS animation to provide feedforward to the user.
* How I used it: I used animation in the homepage. The header text has a subtle slide-in effect after the user enters the site. The down arrow is also continuously bouncing up and down to signify the user to scroll down.
* What it adds to my website: The CSS animation adds more intrigue to the site by drawing the eye. The bouncing arrow adds feedforward by telling the user to scroll down and explore the projects. This helps guide the user and makes the site more intuitive.

## Part 6: Iteration from HW7
I made several major changes from HW7, including adding final image assets for all projects, making the site more interactive, and making the About page more intuitive. I added a feature to randomly generate a project for the user, as well as hand-drawn graphics that are interactive on the homepage. I also added interactivity to the About page using jQuery and buttons.

## Part 7: Major Challenges
Most of my major challenges were surrounding interactivity. For example, I had some initial trouble with using jQuery to fade in an image, so I had to revisit HW6C and W3 Schools to overcome this obstacle. I also had some challenges with Bootstrap to make the site responsive. However, after playing around with the different classes, I was able to get more comfortable and resolve this challenge.
